SMACT
=====

Semiconducting Materials by Analogy and Computational Techniques

Contents
--------

* **smact_data.py** A collection of functions providing elemental properties. Draws on `chemlab`'s database (which in turn draws on openbabel)

Requirements
------------

The main language will be Python with Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.
The [chemlab](http://chemlab.github.com/chemlab) project is also used.
Modifications will be made in [ajjackson's fork](https://github.com/ajjackson/chemlab).

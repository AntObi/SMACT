Introduction
============

Smact is a collection of tools and examples for "low-fi" screening of
potential semiconducting materials through the use of simple chemical
rules.

This approach is heavily inspired by the work of Harrison [1]_ and
Pamplin [2]_. The work is an active project in the `Walsh Materials Design Group <http://wmd-group.github.io>`_.

SMACT is now availabe *via* `pip install smact`. 

We are also developing a set of Jupyter notebook examples [here](https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT/tree/master/examples).
